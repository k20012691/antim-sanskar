        <p>
        ॐ त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे<br />
        सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम्।<br />
        उर्वारुकमिव बन्धनान्<br />
        मृत्योर्मुक्षीय मामृतात् ॥<br />
        Transliteration:
        oṃ tryambakaṃ yajāmahe
        sugandhiṃ puṣṭivardhanam।
        urvārukamiva bandhanān
        mṛtyormukṣīya māmṛtāt ॥<br />
        Hindi Translation:

        हम त्रिनेत्र धारी शिवकी आराधना करते हैं, जो अपनी शक्ति से संसार का पालन करतें हैं।

        उनसे प्रार्थना है कि वे हमें जीवन व मृत्यु के बंधन से मुक्त करे और हमें दिखा दे कि हम कभी भी अपनी अमर प्रकृति से

        अलग नहीं
        होते हैं॥<br />
        English translation:

        I worship that fragrant Shiva of three eyes, the one who nourishes all living entities.
        May he help us severe our bondage with samsara by making us realise that we are never separated

        from our immortal nature.

        <h5>The Power of Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra</h5>
        <p>
          The strength of each mantra is a derivative of 3 aspects:
          Inherent strength - Inherent strength has its roots in its words, meaning, intonations, insights, and
          interpretations. While some mantras focus on praising a particular deity, some focus on
          metaphysical principles, and yet some others such as the Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra focus on
          enabling the Sadhak in fulfilling specific desires.
          </p><p>
          The Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra obviously carries with it immense inherent strength but to tap that fully
          we need to cleanse ourselves internally and cleanse the environment around us.

        <h5>The Benefits of Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra</h5>
        <p>
        All mantras benefit an individual at 3 levels of existence:<br />
        Sthula Shareera (Gross body) – The basic human body which is composed of 5 elements<br />
        Sukshma Shareera (Subtle body) – The mind, the heart, and the intellect<br />
        Karana Shareera (Causal body) – The awareness<br />
        </p>
        <h5>Gross body level</h5>
        We all understand that the body is temporary and has to be shed one day. Hence the basic
        understanding of the Mantra is praying to the 3 eyed lord (who symbolizes awareness of the past,
        present &amp; the future) to give us the energy to either:
        <ul>
          <li>Delay the decay of the body</li>
          <li>Remove a particular disease that ails the body</li>
          <li>Remove a particular disease that ails someone else’s body</li>
          <li>Decay the body with least resistance or pain (in the same way as the cucumber falls off the from
        the stem with ease unlike many fruits/vegetables/ flowers which often hang in pain till they decay
        completely)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Subtle body level</h5>
        <p>
        One of the core principles is that of Karma and the binding cycle of birth and death until the Karmic
        cycle balances fully. While the gross body is bound to decay, the subtle body &amp; the causal body
        continue to exist. The subtle body carries all individual “Vasanas” &amp; “Samskars” (All karmic assets &amp;
        liabilities accumulated over lifetimes)
        </p>
        <p>
        Hence birth &amp; death are taken as 2 sides of the same coin with neither being an imposter nor a
        benefactor. Praying for maintenance of a body in effect can be considered the lowest category. What
        is hence taken as a deeper consequence is how to cleanse our subtle body.
        On contemplation of this aspect, the Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra takes a wholly different meaning.
        What is death after all? The body anyway has to fade away. What continues to remain in every
        single lifetime are the same issues:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fear of death</li>
          <li>Constant state of discontentment and simmering insecurities</li>
          <li>Fear of losses and being unable to retain gains</li>
          <li>Frightening fragility of praise and blame</li>
          <li>Attachment to temporal things as though they are going to be permanent</li>
          <li>Lust, Jealousy, Greed, etc.</li>
          <li>Un-ending cycle of desires</li>
        </ul>
        What are these, if not forms of death itself? Every single day we sink ourselves in these forms of
        decay, not in the gross body but in the subtle body. Healthy mind and intellect are critical to optimal
        functioning as human beings.
        <p>
        Our thoughts define our being and the vibes we carry. The body is only an instrument of the Mind,
        Heart &amp; the intellect. It does its bidding.
        The great story of  Markandeya  symbolizes victory over the fear of death through complete surrender
        to the Deity. The Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra is an exceptionally powerful tool in helping us develop
        our subtle faculties thereby maximizing our potential as human beings.
        The name of the Mantra translates to “The Great Victory over the Great Death”. The Mantra goes
        beyond just the temporary. Once we consider ourselves as one with the Lord (in the same way as
        Markandeya), we automatically become Mrityunjaya – Victorious over death.
        </p>
        <h5>Leveraging Power of The Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra</h5>
        <p>
        The scriptures prescribe the following 3 step process to maximize the potential of a mantra:<br />
        Stage 1 – Shravanam (Listening and internalizing)<br />
        Stage 2 – Mananam (Believing, repeating it regularly and contemplating its meaning)<br />
        Stage 3 – Nididhyasanam (Meditating on its essence and internalizing it such that it becomes as part
        of our very system and spontaneous/natural part of our being)</p>
        <h6>Shravanam</h6>
        In the first stage that a Sadhaka goes through is “Shravanam”. Vedas are also called as “श्रुति”,
        implying the significant focus on hearing and internalizing. Facets of Shravanam include:
        <ul>
          <li>Focussed listening of the mantra to internalize and perfect the chanting accurately</li>
          <li>Clear understanding of the literal meaning of the mantra</li>
          <li>Disciplined approach to time/place/circumstance/ time period during which the mantra would be
        chanted on a regular basis.</li>
        <li>Targeted internal focus on the Deity when chanting the mantra
        Various practitioners recommend steps to ensure optimization of stage 1 including</li>
        <li>Setting specific time and place to chant the mantra</li>
        <li>Setting a specific duration to do the mantra</li>
        <li>Using instruments such as prayer beads etc. to enable counts and focus</li>
        <li>Periodic Satsang with people of similar mindset and spiritual practices</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Stage 2 – Mananam</h6>
        <p>
        The best example to help understand this phase is the point when an individual internalizes a
        particular habit – say going to a gym or a embedding a fitness regime in the daily routine. From that
        point on, there is a sense of discomfort when the individual does ‘not’ do the activity. It becomes
        internalized when one starts seeing the benefits of the discipline materialize in daily life. For
        example, weight loss, gain in body mass, recognition, and appreciation at work, etc.
        </p>
        In the same way, a disciplined approach to a mantra or a “Sadhana” with dedication leads to specific
        benefits such as:
        <ul>
        <li>Improvement in the stability of the mind and breathing</li>
        <li>Increased focus</li>
        <li>Greater calmness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        It is in this phase that the individual must dedicate time to internalizing and contemplating the deeper
        meaning of the mantra and what the mantra is trying to teach us. The beauty of The Vedas is the
        fact that they provide through symbols, directions to the Sadhak and rely heavily on the extent to
        which he/she spends energy in contemplating greater truths.</p>
        <h6>Stage 3 – Nididhyasanam</h6>
        This is the stage where the essence of the mantra starts becoming a part of you and your DNA. It’s
        like learning to ride a cycle. Once you have learned it fully, you don’t need to think about how to
        pedal, how to balance, etc. It becomes a part of you and your personality.
        At this stage, you do not need to chant the mantra. The mantra drops off your personality like a
        cucumber automatically falling off the stem when it’s ripe! Just by contemplation, the gross and the
        subtle bodies are still and quietened into the meditative silence sinking slowly into the Kaarana
        Shareera, the state of pure awareness.
